MY SUMMER PROJECT

In my web project, an interactive webpage has been designed with a variety of buttons, each offering distinct functionalities or services. This project aims to provide users with easy access to a range of features, possibly hosted on AWS, through a simple and user-friendly interface. Each button serves as a gateway to a specific service or action, enabling users to seamlessly perform tasks ranging from sending SMS messages to running Linux commands. In the following descriptions,   explore the purpose and functionality of each button, shedding light on the diverse capabilities this project offers.

AWS Button (x2):
Description: These buttons  represent access to various AWS services or resources.
Functionality: Clicking these buttons  redirect users to specific AWS services such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.

SMS Button:
Description: This button is associated with sending SMS messages.
Functionality: When clicked, it triggers a JavaScript function (sms) that sends an HTTP GET request to a specified backend service,  hosted on AWS, for sending SMS messages. The response is displayed on the webpage.

Docker Button:
Description: This button  is related to Docker containers.
Functionality: Clicking this button  redirect users to an AWS-hosted service that manages Docker containers or allows users to perform Docker-related actions.And allow the user to run the docker commands like pull image , display list of image , etc .

Mail Button:
Description: This button  provides access to email-related services.
Functionality: Clicking this button  redirect users to an AWS-hosted email service or application for email. 

YouTube Button:
Description: This button is to link to YouTube.
Functionality: Clicking this button  opens a new tab or window, directing users to the YouTube website.

WhatsApp Button:
Description: This button is to link to WhatsApp.
Functionality: Clicking this button  opens a new tab or window, directing users to the WhatsApp web interface.

Run Linux Commands:
Description: This section allows users to run Linux commands.
Functionality: Users can enter a Linux command in the input field, submit the form, and potentially trigger an AWS-hosted service that executes the command and returns the output on the webpage.


Each button represents a different feature or service, and the project seems to provide a web-based interface for accessing and interacting with these features,  which are hosted on AWS.
